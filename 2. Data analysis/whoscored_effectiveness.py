# The first goal of this program was calculation of WhoScored.com effectiveness in prediction of managerial decisions in the UEFA Champions League
# matches of the seasons from 2010/2011 to 2019/2020. The second goal was setting the probability of performance for every player of team.
# The way of the calculation was described in README file of this project.
